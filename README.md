# Heart Failure Prediction: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Description

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset related to heart failure clinical records. The primary goal is to understand the underlying patterns, relationships, and characteristics within the data that contribute to heart failure prediction. This notebook serves as a foundational step for building robust machine learning models to predict heart failure events.




## How to Use This Project

To use this project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

*   Python 3.x
*   Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
*   The libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/magedyasse/interface.git
    cd interface
    ```

    *(Note: Since the original repository is empty, this step is illustrative. For this specific project, you would typically download the `03_eda_Final(1).ipynb` file directly.)*

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    It is highly recommended to create a virtual environment.

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Notebook

1.  **Place the dataset:**

    Ensure the `heart_failure_clinical_raw_data.csv` dataset is in the `/content/` directory relative to where you run the notebook, as specified in the notebook:

    ```python
    df = pd.read_csv('/content/heart_failure_clinical_raw_data.csv')
    ```

    *(Note: You might need to adjust the path if your dataset is located elsewhere.)*

2.  **Launch Jupyter:**

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    ```

3.  **Open the notebook:**

    Navigate to and open `03_eda_Final(1).ipynb` in your Jupyter environment.

4.  **Run all cells:**

    Execute all cells in the notebook sequentially to reproduce the EDA. This will include:
    *   Loading necessary libraries.
    *   Loading the dataset.
    *   Performing various data explorations, visualizations, and preprocessing steps.
    *   Training and evaluating machine learning models.

### Understanding the Notebook

The notebook `ade_1.4.ipynb` covers the following key areas:

*   **Data Loading and Initial Inspection:** Loading the `heart_failure_clinical_raw_data.csv` and examining its basic structure, missing values, and data types.
*   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations and statistical summaries to understand the distribution of features, correlations, and relationships between variables, especially concerning the `DEATH_EVENT` target variable.
*   **Data Preprocessing:** Steps like scaling, handling imbalances (e.g., using SMOTEENN), and feature selection.
*   **Model Training and Evaluation:** Application of various machine learning models (Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost) and evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC score.
*   **Model Saving:** The notebook includes steps to save the trained `XGBClassifier` model using `joblib`.




## Future Work

This project lays the groundwork for further advancements in heart failure prediction. Potential future work includes:

*   **Advanced Feature Engineering:** Explore more sophisticated feature engineering techniques to derive new, more predictive features from the existing dataset.
*   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Conduct more exhaustive hyperparameter tuning for all machine learning models using advanced optimization techniques (e.g., Bayesian Optimization, genetic algorithms) to further improve model performance.
*   **Ensemble Methods:** Investigate and implement more complex ensemble methods beyond Random Forest and XGBoost, such as stacking or blending, to leverage the strengths of multiple models.
*   **Deep Learning Models:** Explore the application of deep learning architectures, such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) if time-series data is available, for improved prediction accuracy.
*   **Real-time Prediction System:** Develop a real-time inference system that can take new patient data and predict the likelihood of heart failure events.
*   **Deployment:** Deploy the best-performing model as a web service or an application for practical use.
*   **Interpretability and Explainability:** Utilize advanced interpretability techniques (e.g., LIME, SHAP for other models) to better understand model predictions and identify key factors influencing heart failure outcomes, especially for complex models like XGBoost.
*   **Data Collection and Augmentation:** Explore opportunities to collect more diverse and comprehensive datasets, or augment existing data through synthetic data generation, to enhance model generalization and robustness.
*   **Clinical Validation:** Collaborate with medical professionals to validate the model's predictions in a clinical setting and assess its real-world impact.
